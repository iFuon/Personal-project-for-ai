# Project 34
This repository contains 2 models:  
Our 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> research models [mmsegmentation](https://bitbucket.org/kiriyachristin/comp3888_th16_03_christin/src/master/mmsegmentation/) 
and [DDRNet](https://bitbucket.org/kiriyachristin/comp3888_th16_03_christin/src/master/m4_DDRNet/), storing the programs for 
each model and using Docker containers to create a consistent environment for them to be run in. Documentation for the individual 
models are stored in their respective folders.   

Two other models can be found here:  
Model 1: [DecoupleSegNets](https://bitbucket.org/kiriyachristin/comp3888_th16_03_repom1/src/master/)  
Model 2: [HANet](https://bitbucket.org/abstractblaze/hanet/src/master/)

## Docker Installation
Individual information provided in the model sections. Please install Docker through normal linux pathways.

### Install dependencies:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install  apt-transport-https  ca-certificates  curl  gnupg  lsb-release
```
### Add secret key:
```
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
```
### Add a stable database:
```
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
```
### Install Docker Engine, containerd, and Docker Compose.:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```
### Create docker group:
```
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker 
```
### Protential issuses:

1.Error massages: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?  
run this command to give the AUTHENTICATION.  
```
systemctl start docker
```

2. “Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)” error when Install Docker Engine, containerd, and Docker Compose.  
run this command to Reconfiguring the database.  
```
sudo dpkg --configure -a
```

## General Docker
- Dockerfile: this file will set up a docker image  
- Create a image to run a Dockerfile in directory: docker/  
```
docker build -t {IMAGE_NAME} docker/
```  
For instance:  
```
docker build -t mmsegmentation docker/
```  

- List images to check if the image has been created:
```
docker images
```

## Run the image that created by Dockerfile:
- Host data: the data in the host that export the data into docker image
- Docker: data: import the data from the host as a data directory

```
docker run --gpus all --shm-size=8g -it -v {Host: data}:{Docker: data} {IMAGE_NAME}
```
For instance:
```
docker run --gpus all --shm-size=8g -it -v /home/usyd-05a/data:/mmsegmentation/data mmsegmentation
```  

```diff
! There are few basic packages in Docker, not all of them have been installed. This means you may need to install some packages in the container.
```  

## Process
- Models are first trained, then evaluated. All models will use mean IOU (mIOU) as a measure of their accuracy, defined by the overlap between predicted out and target segmentation mask. 

- The dataset is downloaded from official [website](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/)
```diff
+ NOTE: Any errors with memory, for example pertaining to CUDA, is foremostly likely due to insufficient computing resources on the server. Please try again when there is little usage to see if the issue is resolved.
```

- We use Tensorboards to visulize scalars (follow [instructions here](https://bitbucket.org/abstractblaze/hanet/src/master/) to install tensorboards

## Code Style
As the models are predeveloped and obtained online, code style is not applicable. However any Python files created by the group will use PEP 8.
